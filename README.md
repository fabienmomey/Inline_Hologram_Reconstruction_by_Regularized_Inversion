# Inline Hologram Reconstruction by Regularized Inversion (IHRRI) toolbox
A matlab code for "inverse problems" based image reconstruction of digital in-line holograms. 

This toolbox implements Inverse Problems based algorithms dedicated to image reconstruction in digital in-line holographic microscopy (DHM). Theoretical aspects on DHM and inverse approaches are developed in a tutorial published in JOSA A [1], and this code constitutes a  demonstrator of the algorithms presented in this publication.

The main reconstruction script, named `reconstruction_script.m`, can be executed as is, and can perform a reconstruction from in-line hologram data whose parameters (data and results saving paths, calibration, algorithm settings) have to be set in the file `parameters.m` (refer to it for more details).

All settings are stored in a global structure `EXPE` which also store the reconstruction results. At the end of the script, this structure is saved in a MAT-file `experiment.m` in a timestamped subdirectory contained in the `results` directory that is named as the data hologram file.

PRINCIPLE
--

The code is able to perform 2 kind of "Inverse problems" algorithms aiming at reconstructing an image `X` from an intensity in-line hologram  image `Y`. In this code, `X` is 2-component image ([width,height,2]), each one corresponding respectively to the real and imaginary part of the complex deviation from the unit transmittance plane :

`T = 1 + X(:,:,1) + i X(:,:,2)`

The 2 implemented reconstruction algorithm are:

* The Fienup's Error-Reduction algorithm [2], which stands for a gradient descent algorithm aiming at solving the following problem:

`X = ARG MIN   || C.M(X) - Y ||_2^2	     s.t.     X in Omega`

where

- -  `M(X) = |1 + H.X|` is the square root intensity hologram formation model of `X` using a convolutive propagation operator `H` (the Fresnel kernel is available in this toolbox).

- -   Omega stands for the validity domain of `X` that is enforced as a "projection on constraints" operator in the algorithm. The domain Omega takes the form of bound constraints applied on the real and imaginary parts of `X`:

- - - `RCONST = [XRMIN,XRMAX]`

- - - `ICONST = [XIMIN,XIMAX]`

- - C is a scaling factor that accounts for the intensity of the incident wave `|a_0|^2` as well as the detector gain and quantum efficiency [1].

- The FISTA algorithm [3], which is a proximal gradient descent algorithm aiming at solving the following sparsity problem:

`X = ARG MIN   || C.M(X) - Y ||_W^2 + mu * || X ||_1     s.t.     X in Omega`

where

- - `M(X)` is still the intensity hologram formation model which can take 2 forms:

- - - Considering purely and weakly dephasing or purely absorbing objects, we can use a linearized intensity hologram formation model:

`M(X) = 1 + G.X ~ |1 + H.X|^2 `

where `X` becomes purely real image (size [width,height]) and `G` is a purely real kernel (see the code's documentation for details) which depends on the convolutive propagation operator `H`.

- - - Considering a unknown object:

`M(X) = |1 + H.X|^2`

that models the "full" intensity hologram image from the "complex" image X.

- - `Omega` stands for the validity domain of X that is enforced as a "projection on constraints" operator in the algorithm.

- - `C` is a scaling factor that accounts for the intensity of the incident wave |a_0|^2 as well as the detector gain and quantum efficiency [1].

- - `W` is the inverse noise covariance matrix `C^{-1}`.

- - `|| X ||_1` is a regularizer enforcing a sparsity constraint, weighted by a parameter MU, and applied as a soft-thresholding operator in the algorithm.

Note that the code is able to perform fied-of-view extension in a rigorous way by setting an extension factor in the settings (see "parameters.m").

In the future, an edge-preserving regularizer will be implemented which can be added to the reconstruction criterion (see [1] for theoretical details).
