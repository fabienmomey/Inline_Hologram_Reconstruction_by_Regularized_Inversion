% Inline Hologram Reconstruction by Regularized Inversion (IHRRI) toolbox
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% This script allows to set all the parameters (data and results saving 
% paths, calibration, algorithm settings) to perform a reconstruction of a
% given in-line hologram.
%
% All settings are stored in a global structure EXPE which will also save
% all the reconstruction results.
%
% Here is a list of all the parameters:
% - HOLODIR:        working directory (default: the current directory where
%                   this code is installed).
% - HOLODIR_DATA:   data directory (the DATA directory has to be located
%                   at the root of HOLODIR directory. Some test holograms
%                   are already available in this directory.
% - HOLODATAFILE:   name of the data file.
% - HOLODIR_RESULTS:results directory that will be created at the root of 
%                   HOLODIR directory. Then timestamped subdirectories for 
%                   the current experiment are automatically created in the 
%                   folder tree from HOLODIR_RESULTS.
%
% - FLAG_REC_METH:  'Fienup' or 'RI' => Reconstruction method.
% - FLAG_BACKTRACK: perform backtracking procedure for optimal step in the
%                   FISTA algorithm (only useful if flag_rec_meth = 'RI')
% - FLAG_FIENUP:    true or false => Choose Fienup criterion 
%                   (only useful if flag_rec_meth = 'RI').
% - TYPE_OBJ:       'unknown', 'dephasing' or 'absorbing' => the object of 
%                   interest is purely 'dephasing' or 'absorbing', 
%                   or 'unknown'. It allows to define the propagation
%                   kernel and default bound constraints.
% - FLAG_LINEARIZE: true or false => linearization of the intensity 
%                   formation model (only useful if TYPE_OBJ ~= 'unknown').
%                   If flag_rec_meth = 'Fienup', this flag must be set to 
%                   false to get the correct propagation kernel.
% - FLAG_PAD:       true (recommended) or false => allows zero-padding for  
%                   performing convolutions.
% - FLAG_DISPLAY:   true or false => allows to display results.
%
% - Z_S:            Distance (in m) from the sensor plane to the object 
%                   plane.
% - MAG:            Lens magnification.
% - LAMBDA:         Illumination wavelength (in m).
% - N_0:            Medium refractive index.
% - PIXEL_SIZE:     pixel size (both in x and y) (in m).
% - FOV_WIDTH:      field-of-view width (in pixels).
% - FOV_HEIGHT:     field-of-view height (in pixels).
% - FOV_EXTENSION_FACTOR:   field-of-view extension factor (cannot be <1 ; 
%                           if 1 => no fov extension).
% - REAL_CONSTRAINT:a 2-element vector giving hard constraint parameter for 
%                   the real part of X
%                           \_ TYPE_OBJ = 'dephasing'
%                               \_ default: [0,0] (X is purely imaginary)
%                           \_ TYPE_OBJ = 'absorbing'
%                               \_ default: [-1,0] (X is purely real)
%                           \_ TYPE_OBJ = 'unknown'
%                               \_ default: [-2,0] (because 0 < |T| < 1
%                                                   and -1 < cos(phi) < 1)
% - IMAG_CONSTRAINT:a 2-element vector giving hard constraint
%                          parameter for the imag part of X
%                           \_ TYPE_OBJ = 'dephasing'
%                               \_ default: [-1,1] (X is purely imaginary)
%                           \_ TYPE_OBJ = 'absorbing'
%                               \_ default: [0,0] (X is purely real)
%                           \_ TYPE_OBJ = 'unknown'
%                               \_ default: [-1,1] (because 0 < |T| < 1
%                                                   and -1 < sin(phi) < 1)
% - MUSPARSE:       hyperparameter for the sparsity constraint 
%                   (soft-thresholding operator)
% - MUEDGEPRES:     hyperparameter \mu for the edge-preserving regularizer. 
% - EPSILONEDGEPRES:hyperparameter \epsilon for the edge-preserving regularizer. 
% - MAXITER:        Maximum number of iterations.
