% Test script of functions:
%
% [Hz] = getFresnelPropagator(npix_W, npix_H, pixel_size, lambda, n_0, z, NA, varargin)
% [Hz] = getRayleighSommerfeldPropagator(npix_W, npix_H, pixel_size, lambda, n_0, z, NA, varargin)
% [xconv] = propagationOperator(x,H,varargin)
%
% This script loads a ground truth image (deviation from the 1-transmittance plane) 
% and perform the propagation operator with and without 0-padding. Then it
% applies the backpropagation of the total diffracted wave UTOT.
